On this site you can learn the purpose of the sale, its location, <a href="#items-pricing">what's being sold and its pricing.</a>

                    We've amassed over 50,000 items from donations from the community, estates, companies, and our very own Palo Alto libraries. With these donations and your purchases, we are able to hold this book sale and put 100% of its proceeds back into our local libraries!</p>
